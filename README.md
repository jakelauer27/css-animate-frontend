### Background / About

CSS animations are an incredible way to give sites a very polished and professional look. Unfortunately many people don't realize just how easy they are to implement. I created CSS Ani-mate to help guide those looking to learn how to use CSS Animations. The app not only provides instructions and guides for how to use keyframes and animations, but also a playground to adjust prebuilt animations and easily copy the code for personal projects. For those already comfortable with CSS animations, users can create an account and create and save their own custom animations.
